In the Data City of COMSATS, four heroes came together to build an intelligent digital system. Each hero represented a special data structure and played a unique role.
Imran – Circular Linked List (Leader of the Loop)
Imran manages data in such a way that the last node always connects back to the first node, creating a perfect loop. This continuous structure keeps the system moving without any breaks.
Ahmed Eesa – Circular Linked List Deletion Master
Eesa is responsible for removing elements from the circular list, whether it's the first node, last node, or a specific node in the loop.
Ali Ashraf – Circular Linked List Searching Expert
Ali searches through the circular path to find any element efficiently by following the loop step-by-step.
Taiba Ali – Circular Linked List Display & Traversal
Taiba shows the entire circular list by traversing from one node to the next, looping back to the start, ensuring everything is displayed properly.
Together, these four heroes manage insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal in a powerful Circular Linked List system, keeping the data flow smooth and endless.
